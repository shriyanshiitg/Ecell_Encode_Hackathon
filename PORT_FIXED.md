# ✅ PORT ISSUE FIXED!

I've changed the backend to use **port 5001** instead of 5000.

---

## 🚀 NOW RUN THE BACKEND

In your current terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

✅ **You should see:**
```
🚀 Smart Food Analyzer API running on port 5001
📍 Environment: development
🤖 AI Model: llama-3.3-70b-versatile
```

**⚠️ KEEP THIS TERMINAL OPEN!**

---

## 🎨 THEN START FRONTEND

**Open a NEW terminal** (Cmd+N) and run:

```bash
cd /Users/shriyanshraj/Desktop/ECell_Hackathon/Smart-Ingredient-Analyzer/front-end
npm run dev
```

✅ **You should see:**
```
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

**⚠️ KEEP THIS TERMINAL OPEN TOO!**
