# 🎬 Demo Video Script (2 minutes)

Use this script to create your 2-minute demo video showing the AI-native experience.

## Script Outline

### Opening (0:00 - 0:15) - The Problem
**Visual**: Show traditional app with long ingredient lists and filters

**Voiceover**:
> "Traditional food apps dump ingredient lists and expect YOU to figure out what's safe, what's healthy, and what matters to you. That's cognitive overload at the worst possible time - when you're trying to make a quick decision at the store."

---

### Introduction (0:15 - 0:30) - The Solution
**Visual**: Show your app's chat interface

**Voiceover**:
> "Meet the AI Health Copilot - an AI-native experience that UNDERSTANDS ingredients for you. No forms to fill, no settings to configure. Just snap a photo and ask questions naturally."

---

### Demo Part 1 (0:30 - 0:50) - Context Inference
**Visual**: Show typing a message in chat

**Type**: "I'm concerned about sugar because of diabetes"

**Visual**: AI responds understanding the concern

**Voiceover**:
> "The AI infers what matters to you from natural conversation. Notice how we didn't fill any forms or set any filters - the AI just gets it."

---

### Demo Part 2 (0:50 - 1:10) - Image Scanning
**Visual**: Click camera button, scan a food label (e.g., cereal box, protein bar)

**Voiceover**:
> "Now I'll scan an ingredient label. The AI reads it, understands it, and explains what matters specifically to me."

**Visual**: Wait for analysis to complete

---

### Demo Part 3 (1:10 - 1:30) - AI Analysis
**Visual**: Show the conversational analysis appearing

**Voiceover**:
> "See the difference? Instead of a raw ingredient list, the AI explains:
> - A natural language summary
> - Key insights with reasoning
> - Uncertainty when evidence is mixed
> - Trade-offs between health and taste
>
> Everything is explained in plain language, focused on helping me decide."

---

### Demo Part 4 (1:30 - 1:50) - Follow-up Questions
**Visual**: Type and send "Is this safe for kids?"

**Visual**: AI responds with reasoning

**Voiceover**:
> "The real magic? It's conversational. I can ask follow-up questions naturally. The AI explains its reasoning and stays transparent about what it knows and doesn't know."

---

### Closing (1:50 - 2:00) - Impact
**Visual**: Show summary screen or features

**Voiceover**:
> "This is AI-native design: intent-first, reasoning-driven, and uncertainty-aware. Not just AI added to an old app pattern - a completely new way to understand food ingredients at the moment of decision."

## Recording Tips

### Before Recording:
1. ✅ Have a good food product with clear ingredient label ready
2. ✅ Test the full flow once to ensure it works smoothly
3. ✅ Clear your browser history/close other tabs
4. ✅ Have good lighting for camera scan
5. ✅ Test your microphone

### During Recording:
- **Speak clearly and confidently**
- **Show, don't just tell** - let the UI speak for itself
- **Move smoothly** - practice the clicks beforehand
- **Emphasize the AI-native aspects**:
  - No forms or configuration
  - Intent inference
  - Conversational interaction
  - Reasoning transparency
  - Uncertainty handling

### Screen Recording Tools:
- **Mac**: QuickTime Player or Cmd+Shift+5
- **Windows**: Xbox Game Bar (Win+G) or OBS Studio
- **Chrome Extension**: Loom, Screencastify
- **Mobile**: Built-in screen recorder

### Example Products to Scan:
Good products with clear ingredient labels:
- ✅ Cereal boxes (complex ingredients)
- ✅ Protein bars (many additives)
- ✅ Packaged snacks (preservatives)
- ✅ Instant noodles (processed ingredients)
- ✅ Juice boxes (sweeteners)

Avoid:
- ❌ Products with tiny text
- ❌ Reflective packaging
- ❌ Non-English labels (unless OCR supports it)

## Alternative Flow (If Camera Issues)

### If camera doesn't work well:
1. Show upload button instead
2. "I can also upload photos from my phone or computer"
3. Upload a pre-taken clear image
4. Continue with analysis

This still demonstrates the AI-native experience!
