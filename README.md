## 🎯 The Problem

You're at the grocery store. You pick up a product. **Should you buy it?**

Most apps dump nutrition data. **We reimagined the entire interaction.**

---

## ✨ The Solution

An **AI-native health copilot** that:
- 🗣️ **Converses** with you (not just analyzes)
- 🎯 **Anticipates** your needs (proactive suggestions)
- 🤔 **Asks questions** (learns about you)
- ⚖️ **Explains trade-offs** (benefit vs cost)
- 💾 **Remembers** you (across sessions)
- 📊 **Compares** products (shopping assistant)
- ⭐ **Decides** with you (clear verdicts)

**This isn't AI added to a traditional app. This is AI as the interface.**
